# üì∞ Fake News Detection

This project aims to detect fake news from real news using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, **machine learning**, and **deep learning** models. It also features a **Flask-based web application** where users can input news content and receive a prediction on whether the news is real or fake.

- **Vectorization:** TF-IDF vectorization for converting text data into numerical format.  

### ML Models:
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Naive Bayes  

### DL Models:
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)  
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network for Text)  

### Web Application:
- Built using **Flask**  
- Interactive frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## üß† Machine Learning Workflow

- **Data Loading**  
  Loaded from a structured dataset (e.g., WELFake or Kaggle dataset).

- **Preprocessing**  
  - Lowercasing  
  - Removing punctuation  
  - Tokenization  
  - Stopword removal  
  - Lemmatization

- **TF-IDF Vectorization**  
  Captures the importance of each word in the document relative to the corpus.

- **Model Training & Evaluation**  
  Trained multiple models using training data, evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## ü§ñ Deep Learning Models

### 1. LSTM
- Used to capture the sequential patterns in text.  
- Word embeddings as input, padded sequences.  
- Trained using binary cross-entropy loss.

### 2. CNN for Text
- Convolutional layers capture n-gram patterns.  
- Max-pooling and dense layers for classification.

## üåê Web App

The frontend allows users to:  
- Input any news headline or article.  
- Submit the content.  
- View prediction results instantly (Real or Fake).

Flask handles:  
- Backend prediction using pre-trained models.  
- Rendering templates with results.
