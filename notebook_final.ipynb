         "No comment is expected from Barack Obama Members of the #FYF911 or #FukYoFlag and #BlackLivesMatter movements called for the lynching and hanging of white people and cops. They encouraged others on a radio show Tuesday night to  turn the tide  and kill white people and cops to send a message about the killing of black people in America.One of the F***YoFlag organizers is called  Sunshine.  She has a radio blog show hosted from Texas called,  Sunshine s F***ing Opinion Radio Show. A snapshot of her #FYF911 @LOLatWhiteFear Twitter page at 9:53 p.m. shows that she was urging supporters to  Call now!! #fyf911 tonight we continue to dismantle the illusion of white Below is a SNAPSHOT Twitter Radio Call Invite   #FYF911The radio show aired at 10:00 p.m. eastern standard time.During the show, callers clearly call for  lynching  and  killing  of white people.A 2:39 minute clip from the radio show can be heard here. It was provided to Breitbart Texas by someone who would like to be referred to as  Hannibal.  He has already received death threats as a result of interrupting #FYF911 conference calls.An unidentified black man said  when those mother f**kers are by themselves, that s when when we should start f***ing them up. Like they do us, when a bunch of them ni**ers takin  one of us out, that s how we should roll up.  He said,  Cause we already roll up in gangs anyway. There should be six or seven black mother f**ckers, see that white person, and then lynch their ass. Let s turn the tables. They conspired that if  cops started losing people,  then  there will be a state of emergency. He speculated that one of two things would happen,  a big-ass [R s?????] war,  or  ni**ers, they are going to start backin  up. We are already getting killed out here so what the f**k we got to lose? Sunshine could be heard saying,  Yep, that s true. That s so f**king true. He said,  We need to turn the tables on them. Our kids are getting shot out here. Somebody needs to become a sacrifice on their side.He said,  Everybody ain t down for that s**t, or whatever, but like I say, everybody has a different position of war.  He continued,  Because they don t give a f**k anyway.  He said again,  We might as well utilized them for that s**t and turn the tables on these n**ers. He said, that way  we can start lookin  like we ain t havin  that many casualties, and there can be more causalities on their side instead of ours. They are out their killing black people, black lives don t matter, that s what those mother f**kers   so we got to make it matter to them. Find a mother f**ker that is alone. Snap his ass, and then f***in hang him from a damn tree. Take a picture of it and then send it to the mother f**kers. We  just need one example,  and  then people will start watchin .  This will turn the tables on s**t, he said. He said this will start  a trickle-down effect.  He said that when one white person is hung and then they are just  flat-hanging,  that will start the  trickle-down effect.  He continued,  Black people are good at starting trends. He said that was how  to get the upper-hand. Another black man spoke up saying they needed to kill  cops that are killing us. The first black male said,  That will be the best method right there. Breitbart Texas previously reported how Sunshine was upset when  racist white people  infiltrated and disrupted one of her conference calls. She subsequently released the phone number of one of the infiltrators. The veteran immediately started receiving threatening calls.One of the #F***YoFlag movement supporters allegedly told a veteran who infiltrated their publicly posted conference call,  We are going to rape and gut your pregnant wife, and your f***ing piece of sh*t unborn creature will be hung from a tree. Breitbart Texas previously encountered Sunshine at a Sandra Bland protest at the Waller County Jail in Texas, where she said all white people should be killed. She told journalists and photographers,  You see this nappy-ass hair on my head?   That means I am one of those more militant Negroes.  She said she was at the protest because  these redneck mother-f**kers murdered Sandra Bland because she had nappy hair like me. #FYF911 black radicals say they will be holding the  imperial powers  that are actually responsible for the terrorist attacks on September 11th accountable on that day, as reported by Breitbart Texas. There are several websites and Twitter handles for the movement. Palmetto Star  describes himself as one of the head organizers. He said in a YouTube video that supporters will be burning their symbols of  the illusion of their superiority,  their  false white supremacy,  like the American flag, the British flag, police uniforms, and Ku Klux Klan hoods.Sierra McGrone or  Nocturnus Libertus  posted,  you too can help a young Afrikan clean their a** with the rag of oppression.  She posted two photos, one that appears to be herself, and a photo of a black man, wiping their naked butts with the American flag.For entire story: Breitbart News",

         "Bobby Jindal, raised Hindu, uses story of Christian conversion to woo evangelicals for potential 2016 bid",
         "A dozen politically active pastors came here for a private dinner Friday night to hear a conversion story unique in the context of presidential politics: how Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal traveled from Hinduism to Protestant Christianity and, ultimately, became what he calls an “evangelical Catholic.”\n\nOver two hours, Jindal, 42, recalled talking with a girl in high school who wanted to “save my soul,” reading the Bible in a closet so his parents would not see him and feeling a stir while watching a movie during his senior year that depicted Jesus on the cross.\n\n“I was struck, and struck hard,” Jindal told the pastors. “This was the Son of God, and He had died for our sins.”\n\nJindal’s session with the Christian clergy, who lead congregations in the early presidential battleground states of Iowa and South Carolina, was part of a behind-the-scenes effort by the Louisiana governor to find a political base that could help propel him into the top tier of Republican candidates seeking to run for the White House in 2016.\n\nKnown in GOP circles mostly for his mastery of policy issues such as health care, Jindal, a Rhodes Scholar and graduate of the Ivy League’s Brown University, does not have an obvious pool of activist supporters to help drive excitement outside his home state. So he is harnessing his religious experience in a way that has begun to appeal to parts of the GOP’s influential core of religious conservatives, many of whom have yet to find a favorite among the Republicans eyeing the presidential race.\n\nOther potential 2016 GOP candidates are wooing the evangelical base, including Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.\n\nBut over the weekend in Lynchburg — a mecca of sorts for evangelicals as the home of Liberty University, founded in the 1970s by the Rev. Jerry Falwell — Jindal appeared to make progress.\n\nIn addition to his dinner with the pastors, he delivered a well-received “call to action” address to 40,000 Christian conservatives gathered for Liberty’s commencement ceremony, talking again about his faith while assailing what he said was President Obama’s record of attacking religious liberty.\n\nThe pastors who came to meet Jindal said his intimate descriptions of his experiences stood out.\n\n“He has the convictions, and he has what it takes to communicate them,” said Brad Sherman of Solid Rock Christian Church in Coralville, Iowa. Sherman helped former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee in his winning 2008 campaign for delegates in Iowa.\n\nAnother Huckabee admirer, the Rev. C. Mitchell Brooks of Second Baptist Church in Belton, S.C., said Jindal’s commitment to Christian values and his compelling story put him “on a par” with Huckabee, who was a Baptist preacher before entering politics.\n\nThe visiting pastors flew to Lynchburg over the weekend at the invitation of the American Renewal Project, a well-funded nonprofit group that encourages evangelical Christians to engage in the civic arena with voter guides, get-out-the-vote drives and programs to train pastors in grass-roots activism. The group’s founder, David Lane, has built a pastor network in politically important states such as Iowa, Missouri, Ohio and South Carolina and has led trips to Israel with Paul and others seeking to make inroads with evangelical activists.\n\nThe group that Lane invited to Lynchburg included Donald Wild­mon, a retired minister and founder of the American Family Association, a prominent evangelical activist group that has influence through its network of more than 140 Christian radio stations.\n\nMost of the pastors that Lane’s organization brought to Lynchburg had not met Jindal. But they said he captured their interest recently when he stepped forward to defend Phil Robertson, patriarch of the “Duck Dynasty” television-show family, amid a controversy over disparaging remarks he made about gays in an interview with GQ magazine.\n\nThroughout his Lynchburg visit, Jindal presented himself as a willing culture warrior.\n\nDuring his commencement address Saturday, he took up the cause of twin brothers whose HGTV reality series about renovating and reselling houses, “Flip It Forward,” was canceled last week after a Web site revealed that they had protested against same-sex marriage at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte.\n\nThe siblings, Jason and David Benham, both Liberty graduates, attended the graduation and a private lunch with Jindal, who called the action against them “another demonstration of intolerance from the entertainment industry.”\n\n“If these guys had protested at the Republican Party convention, instead of canceling their show, HGTV would probably have given them a raise,” Jindal said as the Liberty crowd applauded.\n\nHe cited the Hobby Lobby craft store chain, which faced a legal challenge after refusing to provide employees with insurance coverage for contraceptives as required under the Affordable Care Act. Members of the family that owns Hobby Lobby, who have become heroes to many religious conservatives, have said that they are morally opposed to the use of certain types of birth control and that they considered the requirement a violation of their First Amendment right to religious freedom.\n\nThe family was “committed to honor the Lord by being generous employers, paying well above minimum wage and increasing salaries four years in a row even in the midst of the enduring recession,” Jindal told the Liberty graduates. “None of this matters to the Obama administration.”\n\nBut for the pastors who came to see Jindal in action, the governor’s own story was the highlight of the weekend. And in many ways, he was unlike any other aspiring president these activists had met.\n\nPiyush Jindal was born in 1971, four months after his parents arrived in Baton Rouge, La., from their native India. He changed his name to Bobby as a young boy, adopting the name of a character on a favorite television show, “The Brady Bunch.”\n\nHis decision to become a Christian, he told the pastors, did not come in one moment of lightning epiphany. Instead, he said, it happened in phases, growing from small seeds planted over time.\n\nJindal recalled that his closest friend from grade school gave him a Bible with his name emblazoned in gold on the cover as a Christmas present. It struck him initially as an unimpressive gift, Jindal told the pastors.\n\n“Who in the world would spend good money for a Bible when everyone knows you can get one free in any hotel?” he recalled thinking at the time. “And the gold lettering meant I couldn’t give it away or return it.”\n\nHis religious education reached a higher plane during his junior year in high school, he told his dinner audience. He wanted to ask a pretty girl on a date during a hallway conversation, and she started talking about her faith in God and her opposition to abortion. The girl invited him to visit her church.\n\nJindal said he was skeptical and set out to “investigate all these fanciful claims” made by the girl and other friends. He started reading the Bible in his closet at home. “I was unsure how my parents would react,” he said.\n\nAfter the stirring moment when he saw Christ depicted on the cross during the religious movie, the Bible and his very existence suddenly seemed clearer to him, Jindal told the pastors.\n\nJindal did not dwell on his subsequent conversion to Catholicism just a few years later in college, where he said he immersed himself in the traditions of the church.\n\nHe touched on it briefly during the commencement address, noting in passing that “I am best described as an evangelical Catholic.” Mostly, he sought to showcase the ways in which he shares values with other Christian conservatives.\n\n“I read the words of Jesus Christ, and I realized that they were true,” Jindal told the graduates Saturday, offering a less detailed accounting of his conversion than he had done the night before with the pastors. “I used to think that I had found God, but I believe it is more accurate to say that He found me.”",

The RS-28 Sarmat missile, dubbed Satan 2 by Nato, has a top speed of 4.3 miles (7km) per second and has been designed to outfox anti-missile shield systems. The new Sarmat missile could deliver warheads of 40 megatons – 2,000 times as powerful as the atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Scroll down for video Russian President Vladimir Putin is reportedly planning to replace the country’s older SS-18 Satan weapons with the new missiles amid a string of recent disagreements with the West. The Kremlin has stepped up the rhetoric against the West and carried a series of manoeuvres that has infuriated politicians in the US and UK. The pictures were revealed online by chief designers from the Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau. A message posted alongside the picture said: ‘In accordance with the Decree of the Russian Government ‘On the State Defense Order for 2010 and the planning period 2012-2013’, the Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau was instructed to start design and development work on the Sarmat. ‘ The RS-28 Sarmat missile is said to contain 16 nuclear warheads and is capable of destroying an area the size of France or Texas, according to Russian news network Zvezda, which is owned by Russia’s ministry of defence. The weapon is also able to evade radar. It is expected to have a range of 6,213 miles (10,000 km), which would allow Moscow to attack London and \nFOR ENTIRE ARTICLE CLICK LINK",

         "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hackers believed to be working for the Russian government broke into the Democratic National Committee’s computer network, spied on internal communications and accessed research on presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, the committee and security experts said on Tuesday. Two separate groups entered the DNC’s system, and one read email and chat communications for nearly a year before being detected, according to the committee and CrowdStrike, the cyber firm that helped clean up the breach. Russian spies also targeted the networks of Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, as well as the computers of some Republican political action committees, the Washington Post quoted U.S. officials as saying, although details were not available. A Clinton campaign official said there was no evidence the campaign’s information systems had been hacked. A Russian government spokesman denied involvement in the breach. “I completely rule out a possibility that the (Russian) government or the government bodies have been involved in this,” Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, told Reuters in Moscow. The intrusion is emblematic of the sophistication of Russian hackers, who intelligence officials have long viewed as the most talented of U.S. adversaries in cyberspace. The Democratic Party had been aware of efforts to hack Trump material for two months, and U.S. intelligence agencies were involved in efforts to find out who was behind the hacking, a source familiar with Trump opposition research said. The source said Democratic Party operatives believed the hacking was conducted by the Russian government. The research includes material on Trump’s business efforts in Azerbaijan, Georgia, Serbia and Russia, according to information made available to Reuters.         Cyber attacks against political candidates and organizations are common worldwide. U.S. National Intelligence Director James Clapper said last month he was aware of attempted hacks on campaigns and related groups and he expected to see more as the Nov. 8 presidential election nears. U.S. Representative Jim Langevin, a Democrat and co-founder of the congressional cybersecurity caucus, said it was “disconcerting” that independent groups penetrated the DNC and that one was able “to stay embedded for nearly a year.” But the groups are extremely sophisticated, Langevin said, and have previously been implicated on attacks at the White House, the State Department and the German Bundestag, as well as a number of private companies. The DNC contacted CrowdStrike in May and within 24 hours it began investigating unusual activity on the group’s network, said Dmitri Alperovitch, the company’s co-founder and chief technology officer. It identified two hacking groups and both were kicked out this weekend, he said. The first, which CrowdStrike named Cozy Bear, entered the DNC’s systems last summer, according to the firm. It primarily monitored email and chat conversations and may be working for Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB, Alperovitch said.  Russian President Vladimir Putin once ran the FSB. The second group, nicknamed Fancy Bear, is probably working on behalf of Russia’s military, Alperovitch said. It gained entry in late April and “went straight to the oppo research ... on Donald Trump and exfiltrated some of it,” he said. Alperovitch said both groups were among “the best threat actors that we’ve ever encountered” but they did not appear to be working together. He was not sure how the intrusions occurred but suspected the hackers may have leveraged “spearphishing” emails to trick DNC employees into downloading malicious code onto their network. “When we discovered the intrusion, we treated this like the serious incident it is,” Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the DNC, said in a statement. “Our team moved as quickly as possible to kick out the intruders and secure our network.” Trump’s interest in Russia goes back to the 1980s, with a 1990 Vanity Fair article citing news program appearances in which Trump offered his own services as a negotiator with Russia.  Information made available to Reuters indicates Trump tried on at least three occasions - in 2004, 2008 and 2013 - to get involved in business deals in Russia. In 2013, he and an Azerbaijani-Russian oligarch, Aras Agalarov, jointly put on a Miss Universe competition in Moscow, and Trump was photographed with Agalarov’s wife, son and daughter. The last two U.S. presidential cycles in 2008 and 2012 witnessed a barrage of cyber attacks from a range of adversaries targeting President Barack Obama’s campaign and the campaigns of his Republican foes. U.S. intelligence officials have said many previous assaults were linked to Chinese hackers. ",

         " WATCH: Giuliani Demands That Democrats Apologize For Trump’s Racist Birtherism",
         "You know, because in fantasyland Republicans never questioned the citizenship of America s first black president.But that s exactly what they did for years and Donald Trump led the charge by going on or calling into Fox News every chance he could in order to demand President Obama s birth certificate.It was Trump who constantly claimed President Obama was born in Kenya even though Hawaii newspapers from the time announce Obama s birth.Trump and his birther fans were finally utterly humiliated when President Obama released his birth certificate to the public.And now that birtherism is coming back to bite Trump on the ass as he tries to convince black voters that he isn t a racist.Part of the reason why black voters reject Trump is because he questioned the citizenship of President Obama simply because he is black. But Trump wants everyone to pretend he didn t say any nasty things about President Obama and Trump pawn Rudy Giuliani is demanding that Democrats apologize for Trump s birtherism.Giuliani, who has taken to forgetting about 9/11 recently, appeared on CNN with Jake Tapper on Sunday and was grilled because Trump has not apologized for his birtherism. Many African-Americans say they are still troubled by Mr. Trump having suggested over and over, falsely, that the first African-American president was born in Africa and thus ineligible to be president  Tapper began.Giuliani immediately blamed Hillary Clinton for starting the birther conspiracy, but Tapper quickly fact-checked Giuliani, which forced him to blame Clinton s campaign instead.Giuliani then attempted to portray Trump as a hero for  resolving  the conspiracy, claiming that black people  have a faulty memory. He literally thinks black people should thank Trump for being a birther.But Tapper was quick to remind Giuliani that it was President Obama who resolved the conspiracy by releasing his birth certificate in 2011 while Trump was still pushing his birtherism four years later in February 2015 when he told CPAC that he thinks the birth certificate is fake. So apparently Trump thinks it hasn t been resolved, thus blowing Giuliani s claim out of the water. Should he just apologize for this if he really wants to reach out to minority voters?  Tapper asked.Giuliani replied by demanding that Democrats apologize for calling Trump s birtherism racist and went on to bash President Obama. If everybody apologized for all the things they said in politics, all we would be doing on television shows is apologizing. Maybe all the Democrats should apologize for calling Donald Trump a racist and calling him all kinds of terrible names and it gets a little silly. Food stamps have gone up two and a half times under Barack Obama,  he added.  He should be ashamed of himself. Jobs should have gone up two and a half times. My only point is that many African-Americans are still mad about Donald Trump having tried to invalidate Barack Obama by claiming he was born in Africa,  Tapper responded before giving up and moving on.Here s the video via YouTube:Giuliani seems to be forgetting that the recession that began under George W. Bush and the Republicans in 2008 caused more families to need food stamps in the first place, which is why the number of people on food stamps has gone up. Also, President Obama has set a record for the most consecutive months of jobs created and is actually one of the best job-creating presidents over the last 40 years.Once again, Giuliani gets caught talking out of his ass and he must be truly desperate if he is resorting to demanding an apology from Democrats for Trump s racism.Featured Image: Screenshot",

         "Migrants Refuse To Leave Train At Refugee Camp In Hungary\n\nThousands of migrants flooded into a train station in the Hungarian capital Thursday after police lifted a two-day blockade, but some who boarded a train they thought was going to Germany ended up instead at a refugee camp just miles from Budapest.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that \"excited migrants piled into a newly arrived train at the Keleti station in Hungary's capital despite announcements in Hungarian and English that all services from the station to Western Europe had been canceled. A statement on the main departures board said no more trains to Austria or Germany would depart 'due to safety reasons until further notice!'\n\n\"Many migrants, who couldn't understand either language and were receiving no advice from Hungarian officials, scrambled aboard in a standing-room-only crush and hoped for the best,\" the AP said.\n\nScuffles broke out when police ordered the passengers off the train at Bicske, according to the BBC.\n\nMeanwhile, Hungary's prime minister says his country is doing all it can to manage a growing migrant crisis, even as European officials said they will meet this month in Brussels to discuss an effort to \"strengthen the European response\" to the situation.\n\nViktor Orban said the influx of refugees into his country is really \"a German problem\" because that is the intended destination for most of them. Hungarians, along with other Europeans, are \"full of fear\" he says, because \"they see that the European leaders, among them the prime ministers, are not able to control the situation.\"\n\n\"If we would create an image ... just come because we are ready to accept everybody, that would be a moral failure, because that is not the case,\" Orban said after a meeting with European Parliament President Martin Schulz, according to The Washington Post. \"The moral human thing is to make clear, please don't come. Why do you have to go from Turkey to Europe? Turkey is a safe country. Stay there. It's risky to come.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Voice of America reports that British, French and German officials have called for urgent action and plan to hold talks on Sept. 14 in Brussels to address the crisis.\n\nVOA reports: \"The three ministers also called for better processing of migrants in Italy and Greece.\"\n\nAs we've reported, the United Nations believes that more than 300,000 migrants have set out for Europe from North Africa and the Middle East on the Mediterranean Sea so far this year, a 40 percent increase on all of last year.\n\nAs NPR's Middle East editor Larry Kaplow writes: \"On any given day now, hundreds of people, perhaps thousands, are drifting in ships or clinging to boats that are little more than inflatable rafts. They go in other ways, too. Jumping fences in Morocco to get to Spanish territory. Cramming into trucks from Turkey. Riding trains across Europe.\"",

         "Trump tussle gives unpopular Mexican leader much-needed shot in arm",
         "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s combative style has buffeted Mexico’s president for months, but deeply unpopular Enrique Pena Nieto may end up thanking the new U.S. president for prompting offended Mexicans to rally behind their leader.  From billionaire business magnate Carlos Slim to political opponents, there has been a groundswell of support for Pena Nieto, who has cut a lonely figure in months of bruising encounters with Trump. Often referred to by his initials EPN, Pena Nieto is laboring under the worst approval ratings of any Mexican president in decades due to discontent over corruption, gang violence, sluggish growth and a jump in fuel prices.     Trump’s threats to scrap the NAFTA trade deal with Mexico and build a border wall have caused anger and left Mexicans feeling fearful for the future. His challenge to Pena Nieto on Thursday - saying he should skip a planned summit between the two leaders if Mexico wasn’t willing to pay for the wall - was the final straw. Pena Nieto replied a couple of hours later that he had canceled his meeting with Trump, one of the president’s biggest ever hits on Twitter, getting more “likes” than when he personally broke news of the capture of notorious drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman in January of last year. “Bravo EPN!,” cheered former President Vicente Fox, who had initially condemned Pena Nieto for inviting Trump to Mexico for talks last August, and who has waged a colorful and expletive-ridden campaign against the Republican on Twitter. Pena Nieto and Trump talked for about an hour by phone on Friday, pledging to work out their differences and agreeing not to speak about the wall in public for now. Meanwhile, calls for unity grew in Mexico, led by Slim, a normally media-shy 76-year-old who gave a 90-minute news conference in support of the government on Friday. “This is the most surprising example of national unity I’ve seen in my life,” said Slim, who spent several years in the past decade as the world’s richest man. “We have to back the president of Mexico so he can defend our national interests.” Senior opposition leaders also urged a common front. “It’s time to show unity and our commitment to Mexico,” Alejandra Barrales, head of the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), said on Twitter. Pena Nieto’s credibility has been battered by a widespread public perception that he has failed to battle corruption and indeed even encouraged it since a conflict-of-interest row embroiled him, his wife and a top minister in late 2014. Some opposition critics fear the government will try to use Trump as a screen to distract from its failings. However, two senior officials told Reuters they hoped Pena Nieto would seize the moment to act quickly and decisively to improve his image. Expressions of dismay at Trump’s behavior towards Mexico have almost become a national pastime, and talk of boycotts against U.S. companies is gathering steam on social media. Slim, when asked about boycotting at his news conference, said it wasn’t a good idea to turn on U.S. companies, which are creating jobs in Mexico. Some foreign companies voiced support for Mexico too. “I feel Mexico is being subjected to terror at the moment,” said Andreas Schindler, co-owner of German fruit wholesaler Don Limon’s parent Pilz Schindler, by phone from Hamburg. “We’re right behind Mexico.” ",

         "Goldman Sachs Endorses Hillary Clinton For President",
         "Goldman Sachs Endorses Hillary Clinton For President For Goldman Sachs, was there really any other choice this cycle? | October 27, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, is greeted by Hillary Clinton at a panel discussion at the Clinton Global Initiative, Sept. 24, 2014 in New York. \nPublished in partnership with Shadowproof . \nHe’s with her. On Sunday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earned the endorsement of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein —an endorsement she had been working toward for years. \nAs was revealed by Wikileaks, Hillary Clinton spent the run up to her presidential campaign giving speeches to Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, where she praised their talents and explained her positions on financial regulation. \nOn October 24, 2013, Clinton told Goldman Sachs that Dodd-Frank had to be done mostly for “political reasons” because Congress needed to look like it was doing something about the crisis. She said, “There’s nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad. How do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works? And the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.” \nYes, she essentially endorsed Wall Street writing the rules because Wall Street knows its business best and complained to Goldman Sachs that regulations had frightened bankers. \n“I mean, right now, there are so many places in our country where the banks are not doing what they need to do because they’re scared of regulations, they’re scared of the other shoe dropping, they’re just plain scared, so credit is not flowing the way it needs to to restart economic growth,” Clinton said. “So people are, you know, a little — they’re still uncertain, and they’re uncertain both because they don’t know what might come next in terms of regulations, but they’re also uncertain because of changes in a global economy that we’re only beginning to take hold of.” \nMusic to Wall Street’s ears. For Goldman Sachs, was there really any other choice this cycle? After all, they did pay Hillary Clinton $675,000 for those three speeches, and have generously supported her political career. \nDespite her private comments to Goldman Sachs, Hillary Clinton has taken a tough public position on Wall Street during the campaign, likely due to Senator Bernie Sanders’ success in the primaries. Of course, Wikileaks also revealed that Clinton told the National Multi-housing Council in a private speech that “you need both a public and a private position.” \nSo the real question is, what do Blankfein and Goldman want in return and what is Clinton’s private position on giving it to them?

         "no comment is expected from barack obama members of the #fyf911 or #fukyoflag and #blacklivesmatter movements called for the lynching and hanging of white people and cops. they encouraged others on a radio show tuesday night to  turn the tide  and kill white people and cops to send a message about the killing of black people in america.one of the f***yoflag organizers is called  sunshine.  she has a radio blog show hosted from texas called,  sunshine s f***ing opinion radio show. a snapshot of her #fyf911 @lolatwhitefear twitter page at 9:53 p.m. shows that she was urging supporters to  call now!! #fyf911 tonight we continue to dismantle the illusion of white below is a snapshot twitter radio call invite   #fyf911the radio show aired at 10:00 p.m. eastern standard time.during the show, callers clearly call for  lynching  and  killing  of white people.a 2:39 minute clip from the radio show can be heard here. it was provided to breitbart texas by someone who would like to be referred to as  hannibal.  he has already received death threats as a result of interrupting #fyf911 conference calls.an unidentified black man said  when those mother f**kers are by themselves, that s when when we should start f***ing them up. like they do us, when a bunch of them ni**ers takin  one of us out, that s how we should roll up.  he said,  cause we already roll up in gangs anyway. there should be six or seven black mother f**ckers, see that white person, and then lynch their ass. let s turn the tables. they conspired that if  cops started losing people,  then  there will be a state of emergency. he speculated that one of two things would happen,  a big-ass [r s?????] war,  or  ni**ers, they are going to start backin  up. we are already getting killed out here so what the f**k we got to lose? sunshine could be heard saying,  yep, that s true. that s so f**king true. he said,  we need to turn the tables on them. our kids are getting shot out here. somebody needs to become a sacrifice on their side.he said,  everybody ain t down for that s**t, or whatever, but like i say, everybody has a different position of war.  he continued,  because they don t give a f**k anyway.  he said again,  we might as well utilized them for that s**t and turn the tables on these n**ers. he said, that way  we can start lookin  like we ain t havin  that many casualties, and there can be more causalities on their side instead of ours. they are out their killing black people, black lives don t matter, that s what those mother f**kers   so we got to make it matter to them. find a mother f**ker that is alone. snap his ass, and then f***in hang him from a damn tree. take a picture of it and then send it to the mother f**kers. we  just need one example,  and  then people will start watchin .  this will turn the tables on s**t, he said. he said this will start  a trickle-down effect.  he said that when one white person is hung and then they are just  flat-hanging,  that will start the  trickle-down effect.  he continued,  black people are good at starting trends. he said that was how  to get the upper-hand. another black man spoke up saying they needed to kill  cops that are killing us. the first black male said,  that will be the best method right there. breitbart texas previously reported how sunshine was upset when  racist white people  infiltrated and disrupted one of her conference calls. she subsequently released the phone number of one of the infiltrators. the veteran immediately started receiving threatening calls.one of the #f***yoflag movement supporters allegedly told a veteran who infiltrated their publicly posted conference call,  we are going to rape and gut your pregnant wife, and your f***ing piece of sh*t unborn creature will be hung from a tree. breitbart texas previously encountered sunshine at a sandra bland protest at the waller county jail in texas, where she said all white people should be killed. she told journalists and photographers,  you see this nappy-ass hair on my head?   that means i am one of those more militant negroes.  she said she was at the protest because  these redneck mother-f**kers murdered sandra bland because she had nappy hair like me. #fyf911 black radicals say they will be holding the  imperial powers  that are actually responsible for the terrorist attacks on september 11th accountable on that day, as reported by breitbart texas. there are several websites and twitter handles for the movement. palmetto star  describes himself as one of the head organizers. he said in a youtube video that supporters will be burning their symbols of  the illusion of their superiority,  their  false white supremacy,  like the american flag, the british flag, police uniforms, and ku klux klan hoods.sierra mcgrone or  nocturnus libertus  posted,  you too can help a young afrikan clean their a** with the rag of oppression.  she posted two photos, one that appears to be herself, and a photo of a black man, wiping their naked butts with the american flag.for entire story: breitbart news",

         "bobby jindal, raised hindu, uses story of christian conversion to woo evangelicals for potential 2016 bid",
         "a dozen politically active pastors came here for a private dinner friday night to hear a conversion story unique in the context of presidential politics: how louisiana gov. bobby jindal traveled from hinduism to protestant christianity and, ultimately, became what he calls an “evangelical catholic.”\n\nover two hours, jindal, 42, recalled talking with a girl in high school who wanted to “save my soul,” reading the bible in a closet so his parents would not see him and feeling a stir while watching a movie during his senior year that depicted jesus on the cross.\n\n“i was struck, and struck hard,” jindal told the pastors. “this was the son of god, and he had died for our sins.”\n\njindal’s session with the christian clergy, who lead congregations in the early presidential battleground states of iowa and south carolina, was part of a behind-the-scenes effort by the louisiana governor to find a political base that could help propel him into the top tier of republican candidates seeking to run for the white house in 2016.\n\nknown in gop circles mostly for his mastery of policy issues such as health care, jindal, a rhodes scholar and graduate of the ivy league’s brown university, does not have an obvious pool of activist supporters to help drive excitement outside his home state. so he is harnessing his religious experience in a way that has begun to appeal to parts of the gop’s influential core of religious conservatives, many of whom have yet to find a favorite among the republicans eyeing the presidential race.\n\nother potential 2016 gop candidates are wooing the evangelical base, including sens. rand paul (ky.) and ted cruz (tex.) and indiana gov. mike pence.\n\nbut over the weekend in lynchburg — a mecca of sorts for evangelicals as the home of liberty university, founded in the 1970s by the rev. jerry falwell — jindal appeared to make progress.\n\nin addition to his dinner with the pastors, he delivered a well-received “call to action” address to 40,000 christian conservatives gathered for liberty’s commencement ceremony, talking again about his faith while assailing what he said was president obama’s record of attacking religious liberty.\n\nthe pastors who came to meet jindal said his intimate descriptions of his experiences stood out.\n\n“he has the convictions, and he has what it takes to communicate them,” said brad sherman of solid rock christian church in coralville, iowa. sherman helped former arkansas governor mike huckabee in his winning 2008 campaign for delegates in iowa.\n\nanother huckabee admirer, the rev. c. mitchell brooks of second baptist church in belton, s.c., said jindal’s commitment to christian values and his compelling story put him “on a par” with huckabee, who was a baptist preacher before entering politics.\n\nthe visiting pastors flew to lynchburg over the weekend at the invitation of the american renewal project, a well-funded nonprofit group that encourages evangelical christians to engage in the civic arena with voter guides, get-out-the-vote drives and programs to train pastors in grass-roots activism. the group’s founder, david lane, has built a pastor network in politically important states such as iowa, missouri, ohio and south carolina and has led trips to israel with paul and others seeking to make inroads with evangelical activists.\n\nthe group that lane invited to lynchburg included donald wild­mon, a retired minister and founder of the american family association, a prominent evangelical activist group that has influence through its network of more than 140 christian radio stations.\n\nmost of the pastors that lane’s organization brought to lynchburg had not met jindal. but they said he captured their interest recently when he stepped forward to defend phil robertson, patriarch of the “duck dynasty” television-show family, amid a controversy over disparaging remarks he made about gays in an interview with gq magazine.\n\nthroughout his lynchburg visit, jindal presented himself as a willing culture warrior.\n\nduring his commencement address saturday, he took up the cause of twin brothers whose hgtv reality series about renovating and reselling houses, “flip it forward,” was canceled last week after a web site revealed that they had protested against same-sex marriage at the 2012 democratic national convention in charlotte.\n\nthe siblings, jason and david benham, both liberty graduates, attended the graduation and a private lunch with jindal, who called the action against them “another demonstration of intolerance from the entertainment industry.”\n\n“if these guys had protested at the republican party convention, instead of canceling their show, hgtv would probably have given them a raise,” jindal said as the liberty crowd applauded.\n\nhe cited the hobby lobby craft store chain, which faced a legal challenge after refusing to provide employees with insurance coverage for contraceptives as required under the affordable care act. members of the family that owns hobby lobby, who have become heroes to many religious conservatives, have said that they are morally opposed to the use of certain types of birth control and that they considered the requirement a violation of their first amendment right to religious freedom.\n\nthe family was “committed to honor the lord by being generous employers, paying well above minimum wage and increasing salaries four years in a row even in the midst of the enduring recession,” jindal told the liberty graduates. “none of this matters to the obama administration.”\n\nbut for the pastors who came to see jindal in action, the governor’s own story was the highlight of the weekend. and in many ways, he was unlike any other aspiring president these activists had met.\n\npiyush jindal was born in 1971, four months after his parents arrived in baton rouge, la., from their native india. he changed his name to bobby as a young boy, adopting the name of a character on a favorite television show, “the brady bunch.”\n\nhis decision to become a christian, he told the pastors, did not come in one moment of lightning epiphany. instead, he said, it happened in phases, growing from small seeds planted over time.\n\njindal recalled that his closest friend from grade school gave him a bible with his name emblazoned in gold on the cover as a christmas present. it struck him initially as an unimpressive gift, jindal told the pastors.\n\n“who in the world would spend good money for a bible when everyone knows you can get one free in any hotel?” he recalled thinking at the time. “and the gold lettering meant i couldn’t give it away or return it.”\n\nhis religious education reached a higher plane during his junior year in high school, he told his dinner audience. he wanted to ask a pretty girl on a date during a hallway conversation, and she started talking about her faith in god and her opposition to abortion. the girl invited him to visit her church.\n\njindal said he was skeptical and set out to “investigate all these fanciful claims” made by the girl and other friends. he started reading the bible in his closet at home. “i was unsure how my parents would react,” he said.\n\nafter the stirring moment when he saw christ depicted on the cross during the religious movie, the bible and his very existence suddenly seemed clearer to him, jindal told the pastors.\n\njindal did not dwell on his subsequent conversion to catholicism just a few years later in college, where he said he immersed himself in the traditions of the church.\n\nhe touched on it briefly during the commencement address, noting in passing that “i am best described as an evangelical catholic.” mostly, he sought to showcase the ways in which he shares values with other christian conservatives.\n\n“i read the words of jesus christ, and i realized that they were true,” jindal told the graduates saturday, offering a less detailed accounting of his conversion than he had done the night before with the pastors. “i used to think that i had found god, but i believe it is more accurate to say that he found me.”",

         "all we can say on this one is it s about time someone sued the southern poverty law center!on tuesday, d. james kennedy ministries (djkm) filed a lawsuit against the southern poverty law center (splc), the charity navigation organization guidestar, and amazon, for defamation, religious discrimination, and trafficking in falsehood. the splc listed djkm as a  hate group,  while guidestar also categorized it in those terms, and amazon kept the ministry off of its charity donation program, amazon smile. we embarked today on a journey to right a terrible wrong,  dr. frank wright, president and ceo at djkm, said in a statement tuesday.  those who knowingly label christian ministries as  hate  groups, solely for subscribing to the historic christian faith, are either woefully uninformed or willfully deceitful. in the case of the southern poverty law center, our lawsuit alleges the latter. the splc has labeled djkm an  anti-lgbt hate group  for its opposition to same-sex marriage and transgenderism.  these false and illegal characterizations have a chilling effect on the free exercise of religion and on religious free speech for all people of faith,  wright declared. after having given the splc an opportunity to retract, we have undertaken this legal action, seeking a trial by a jury of our peers, to preserve our own rights under the law and to defend the religious free speech rights of all americans,  the djkm president concluded.the lawsuit laid out charges against the splc, guidestar, and amazon.read more: pjm",

         "bobby jindal raised hindu uses story of christian conversion to woo evangelicals for potential 2016 bid",
         "a dozen politically active pastors came here for a private dinner friday night to hear a conversion story unique in the context of presidential politics how louisiana gov bobby jindal traveled from hinduism to protestant christianity and ultimately became what he calls an “evangelical catholic”\n\nover two hours jindal 42 recalled talking with a girl in high school who wanted to “save my soul” reading the bible in a closet so his parents would not see him and feeling a stir while watching a movie during his senior year that depicted jesus on the cross\n\n“i was struck and struck hard” jindal told the pastors “this was the son of god and he had died for our sins”\n\njindal’s session with the christian clergy who lead congregations in the early presidential battleground states of iowa and south carolina was part of a behindthescenes effort by the louisiana governor to find a political base that could help propel him into the top tier of republican candidates seeking to run for the white house in 2016\n\nknown in gop circles mostly for his mastery of policy issues such as health care jindal a rhodes scholar and graduate of the ivy league’s brown university does not have an obvious pool of activist supporters to help drive excitement outside his home state so he is harnessing his religious experience in a way that has begun to appeal to parts of the gop’s influential core of religious conservatives many of whom have yet to find a favorite among the republicans eyeing the presidential race\n\nother potential 2016 gop candidates are wooing the evangelical base including sens rand paul ky and ted cruz tex and indiana gov mike pence\n\nbut over the weekend in lynchburg — a mecca of sorts for evangelicals as the home of liberty university founded in the 1970s by the rev jerry falwell — jindal appeared to make progress\n\nin addition to his dinner with the pastors he delivered a wellreceived “call to action” address to 40000 christian conservatives gathered for liberty’s commencement ceremony talking again about his faith while assailing what he said was president obama’s record of attacking religious liberty\n\nthe pastors who came to meet jindal said his intimate descriptions of his experiences stood out\n\n“he has the convictions and he has what it takes to communicate them” said brad sherman of solid rock christian church in coralville iowa sherman helped former arkansas governor mike huckabee in his winning 2008 campaign for delegates in iowa\n\nanother huckabee admirer the rev c mitchell brooks of second baptist church in belton sc said jindal’s commitment to christian values and his compelling story put him “on a par” with huckabee who was a baptist preacher before entering politics\n\nthe visiting pastors flew to lynchburg over the weekend at the invitation of the american renewal project a wellfunded nonprofit group that encourages evangelical christians to engage in the civic arena with voter guides getoutthevote drives and programs to train pastors in grassroots activism the group’s founder david lane has built a pastor network in politically important states such as iowa missouri ohio and south carolina and has led trips to israel with paul and others seeking to make inroads with evangelical activists\n\nthe group that lane invited to lynchburg included donald wild­mon a retired minister and founder of the american family association a prominent evangelical activist group that has influence through its network of more than 140 christian radio stations\n\nmost of the pastors that lane’s organization brought to lynchburg had not met jindal but they said he captured their interest recently when he stepped forward to defend phil robertson patriarch of the “duck dynasty” televisionshow family amid a controversy over disparaging remarks he made about gays in an interview with gq magazine\n\nthroughout his lynchburg visit jindal presented himself as a willing culture warrior\n\nduring his commencement address saturday he took up the cause of twin brothers whose hgtv reality series about renovating and reselling houses “flip it forward” was canceled last week after a web site revealed that they had protested against samesex marriage at the 2012 democratic national convention in charlotte\n\nthe siblings jason and david benham both liberty graduates attended the graduation and a private lunch with jindal who called the action against them “another demonstration of intolerance from the entertainment industry”\n\n“if these guys had protested at the republican party convention instead of canceling their show hgtv would probably have given them a raise” jindal said as the liberty crowd applauded\n\nhe cited the hobby lobby craft store chain which faced a legal challenge after refusing to provide employees with insurance coverage for contraceptives as required under the affordable care act members of the family that owns hobby lobby who have become heroes to many religious conservatives have said that they are morally opposed to the use of certain types of birth control and that they considered the requirement a violation of their first amendment right to religious freedom\n\nthe family was “committed to honor the lord by being generous employers paying well above minimum wage and increasing salaries four years in a row even in the midst of the enduring recession” jindal told the liberty graduates “none of this matters to the obama administration”\n\nbut for the pastors who came to see jindal in action the governor’s own story was the highlight of the weekend and in many ways he was unlike any other aspiring president these activists had met\n\npiyush jindal was born in 1971 four months after his parents arrived in baton rouge la from their native india he changed his name to bobby as a young boy adopting the name of a character on a favorite television show “the brady bunch”\n\nhis decision to become a christian he told the pastors did not come in one moment of lightning epiphany instead he said it happened in phases growing from small seeds planted over time\n\njindal recalled that his closest friend from grade school gave him a bible with his name emblazoned in gold on the cover as a christmas present it struck him initially as an unimpressive gift jindal told the pastors\n\n“who in the world would spend good money for a bible when everyone knows you can get one free in any hotel” he recalled thinking at the time “and the gold lettering meant i couldn’t give it away or return it”\n\nhis religious education reached a higher plane during his junior year in high school he told his dinner audience he wanted to ask a pretty girl on a date during a hallway conversation and she started talking about her faith in god and her opposition to abortion the girl invited him to visit her church\n\njindal said he was skeptical and set out to “investigate all these fanciful claims” made by the girl and other friends he started reading the bible in his closet at home “i was unsure how my parents would react” he said\n\nafter the stirring moment when he saw christ depicted on the cross during the religious movie the bible and his very existence suddenly seemed clearer to him jindal told the pastors\n\njindal did not dwell on his subsequent conversion to catholicism just a few years later in college where he said he immersed himself in the traditions of the church\n\nhe touched on it briefly during the commencement address noting in passing that “i am best described as an evangelical catholic” mostly he sought to showcase the ways in which he shares values with other christian conservatives\n\n“i read the words of jesus christ and i realized that they were true” jindal told the graduates saturday offering a less detailed accounting of his conversion than he had done the night before with the pastors “i used to think that i had found god but i believe it is more accurate to say that he found me”",

         "langues enfants en octobre dernier bella est devenue célèbre du jour au lendemain grâce au projet personnes extraordinaires présenté par la chaîne de télévision rossiya 1 la vidéo dans laquelle la petite fille répond aux questions chante des chansons et parle dans plusieurs langues suscité un grand intérêt sur les réseaux sociaux « je sens stupide par rapport à cet enfant » écrivaient les internautes dans les commentaires ioulia deviatkina la mère de bella affirme que sa fille n’est pas un enfant prodige ses parents accordant simplement beaucoup d’attention à son développement « les enfants n’ont pas forcément besoin de parler sept langues mais chaque petit est capable de maîtriser deux ou trois langues » assure ioulia les parents de bella sont conscients que dans la vraie vie la petite fille n’utilisera pas les sept langues activement c’est tout simplement impossible « quand elle ira à l’école nous nous concentrerons sur l’anglais le français et le chinois » précise la mère de la petite fille « nous n’avons pas peur que bella s’ennuie en classe non plus elle possède les connaissances obligatoires pour tout enfant de quatre ans simplement elle est capable de parler sur ces sujets « enfantins » dans plusieurs langues différentes » le gazouillis en français la mère de la petite fille est linguiste de formation et enseigne l’anglais aux enfants depuis sept ans son père travaille à l’institut de recherche radio c’est une famille de classe moyenne cependant pour les parents de bella le développement de leur fille est l’investissement le plus important окт 18 2016 в 335 pdt initialement les parents de bella voulaient qu’elle parle couramment l’anglais ainsi dès la naissance sa mère lui parlait en deux langues les alternant jour après jour elle veillait à ce que les langues ne se mélangent pas et interdisait à sa fille d’utiliser des mots russes dans les conversations en anglais quand bella eu 10 mois ses parents ont rajouté le français elle ne savait pas parler mais pouvait montrer du doigt les objets nommés par les adultes lire aussi de jeunes mères russes racontent comment leur enfant bouleversé leur vie bella appris à lire avant de commencer à parler dès l’âge de cinq mois ses parents lui apprenaient à lire grâces à des cartes spéciales par exemple quand montrait à bella âgée de neuf mois le mot « main » en russe ou en anglais elle montrait sa main avant l’âge d’un la petite fille appris 60 de ces cartes avec ses parents elle commencéà lire couramment à l’âge de deux ans dessins animés en chinois à deux ans bella savait parler avec des phrases courtes et lire avec aisance dans trois langues avant l’âge de trois ans ses parents ont rajouté le chinois au « programme » ioulia raconte que la petite fille montrait un grand intérêt pour la nouvelle langue elle demandait même qu’on lui mette des dessins animés en chinois окт 5 2016 в 526 pdt à l’âge de 3 ans et 2 mois la petite bella étudiait volontiers l’espagnol et l’allemand mais aussi la danse le violon et le chant puis rajouté l’arabe bella se promène joue à cachecache et lit des livres pour enfants mais elle le fait en plusieurs langues différentes tous ses cours se déroulent sous forme de jeu ses parents organisent des voyages ludiques avec des locuteurs natifs elle fréquente un club de théâtre en anglais apprend le dessin en français la danse en espagnol et suit des cours de patinage avec un locuteur allemand par ailleurs ses parents lui organisent régulièrement des cours collectifs avec des amis qui sont également élevés dans un milieu multilingue lire aussi le russe cinquième langue dans les écoles de l’ue outil de développement du cerveau les chercheurs confirment que la capacitéà parler plusieurs langues et de passer de l’une à l’autre dépend de l’interaction entre différentes zones du cerveau elles se mettent en marche en fonction des caractéristiques phonétiques de la langue de son système grammatical de l’imagerie linguistique et même de la tonalité de la prononciation « chaque nouvelle expérience se reflète dans le cerveau par l’émergence de connexions nerveuses l’hippocampe responsable de la mémoire stimule la croissance de nouveaux neurones le volume de certaines zones du cerveau croît littéralement » explique la psychologue tatiana diatchenko окт 16 2016 в 118 pdt « le multilinguisme une influence positive sur le développement général de l’enfant même s’il peut provoquer un retard du développement du langage à cette étape par rapport aux enfants qui n’apprennent qu’une seule langue » explique kira ivanonva spécialiste de l’institut de recherches linguistiques auprès de l’académie russe des sciences cependant un apprentissage précoce ne garantit pas que l’enfant parlera couramment la langue plus tard « je connais une mère qui ne parlait qu’anglais avec son enfant à partir de l’âge de trois ans aujourd’hui ce petit n’est même pas capable de maîtriser le programme d’une école normale nonspécialisée » raconte maria molina chercheuse à l’institut de linguistique auprès de l’académie russe des sciences lire aussi",

laquelle la petite fille répond aux questions chante des chansons et parle dans plusieurs langues suscité un grand intérêt sur les réseaux sociaux « je sens stupide par rapport à cet enfant » écrivaient les internautes dans les commentaires ioulia deviatkina la mère de bella affirme que sa fille n’est pas un enfant prodige ses parents accordant simplement beaucoup d’attention à son développement « les enfants n’ont pas forcément besoin de parler sept langues mais chaque petit est capable de maîtriser deux ou trois langues » assure ioulia les parents de bella sont conscients que dans la vraie vie la petite fille n’utilisera pas les sept langues activement c’est tout simplement impossible « quand elle ira à l’école nous nous concentrerons sur l’anglais le français et le chinois » précise la mère de la petite fille « nous n’avons pas peur que bella s’ennuie en classe non plus elle possède les connaissances obligatoires pour tout enfant de quatre ans simplement elle est capable de parler sur ces sujets « enfantins » dans plusieurs langues différentes » le gazouillis en français la mère de la petite fille est linguiste de formation et enseigne l’anglais aux enfants depuis sept ans son père travaille à l’institut de recherche radio c’est une famille de classe moyenne cependant pour les parents de bella le développement de leur fille est l’investissement le plus important окт 18 2016 в 335 pdt initialement les parents de bella voulaient qu’elle parle couramment l’anglais ainsi dès la naissance sa mère lui parlait en deux langues les alternant jour après jour elle veillait à ce que les langues ne se mélangent pas et interdisait à sa fille d’utiliser des mots russes dans les conversations en anglais quand bella eu 10 mois ses parents ont rajouté le français elle ne savait pas parler mais pouvait montrer du doigt les objets nommés par les adultes lire aussi de jeunes mères russes racontent comment leur enfant bouleversé leur vie bella appris à

ou en anglais elle montrait sa main avant l’âge d’un la petite fille appris 60 de ces cartes avec ses parents elle commencéà lire couramment à l’âge de deux ans dessins animés en chinois à deux ans bella savait parler avec des phrases courtes et lire avec aisance dans trois langues avant l’âge de trois ans ses parents ont rajouté le chinois au « programme » ioulia raconte que la petite fille montrait un grand intérêt pour la nouvelle langue elle demandait même qu’on lui mette des dessins animés en chinois окт 5 2016 в 526 pdt à l’âge de 3 ans et 2 mois la petite bella étudiait volontiers l’espagnol et l’allemand mais aussi la danse le violon et le chant puis rajouté l’arabe bella se promène joue à cachecache et lit des livres pour enfants mais elle le fait en plusieurs langues différentes tous ses cours se déroulent sous forme de jeu ses parents organisent des voyages ludiques avec des locuteurs natifs elle fréquente un club de théâtre en anglais apprend le dessin en

couramment la langue plus tard « je connais une mère qui ne parlait qu’anglais avec son enfant à partir de l’âge de trois ans aujourd’hui ce petit n’est même pas capable de maîtriser le programme

laquelle la petite fille répond aux questions chante des chansons et parle dans plusieurs langues suscité un grand intérêt sur les réseaux sociaux « je sens stupide par rapport à cet enfant » écrivaient les internautes dans les commentaires ioulia deviatkina la mère de bella affirme que sa fille n’est pas un enfant prodige ses parents accordant simplement beaucoup d’attention à son développement « les enfants n’ont pas forcément besoin de parler sept langues mais chaque petit est capable de maîtriser deux ou trois langues » assure ioulia les parents de bella sont conscients que dans la vraie vie la petite fille n’utilisera pas les sept langues activement c’est tout simplement impossible « quand elle ira à l’école nous nous concentrerons sur l’anglais le français et le chinois » précise la mère de la petite fille « nous n’avons pas peur que bella s’ennuie en classe non plus elle possède les connaissances obligatoires pour tout enfant de quatre ans simplement elle est capable de parler sur ces sujets « enfantins » dans plusieurs langues différentes » le gazouillis en français la mère de la petite fille est linguiste de formation et enseigne l’anglais aux enfants depuis sept ans son père travaille à l’institut de recherche radio c’est une famille de classe moyenne cependant pour les parents de bella le développement de leur fille est l’investissement le plus important окт 18 2016 в 335 pdt initialement les parents de bella voulaient qu’elle parle couramment l’anglais ainsi dès la naissance sa mère lui parlait en deux langues les alternant jour après jour elle veillait à ce que les langues ne se mélangent pas et interdisait à sa fille d’utiliser des mots russes dans les conversations en anglais quand bella eu 10 mois ses parents ont rajouté le français elle ne savait pas parler mais pouvait montrer du doigt les objets nommés par les adultes lire aussi de jeunes mères russes racontent comment leur enfant bouleversé leur vie bella appris à lire avant de commencer à parler dès l’âge de cinq mois ses parents lui apprenaient à lire grâces à des cartes spéciales par exemple quand montrait à bella âgée de neuf mois le mot « main » en russe ou en anglais elle montrait sa main avant l’âge d’un la petite fille appris 60 de ces cartes avec ses parents elle commencéà lire couramment à l’âge de deux ans dessins animés en chinois à deux ans bella savait parler avec des phrases courtes et lire avec aisance dans trois langues avant l’âge de trois ans ses parents ont rajouté le chinois au « programme » ioulia raconte que la petite fille montrait un grand intérêt pour la nouvelle langue elle demandait même qu’on lui mette des dessins animés en chinois окт 5 2016 в 526 pdt à l’âge de 3 ans et 2 mois la petite bella étudiait volontiers l’espagnol et l’allemand mais aussi la danse le violon et le chant puis rajouté l’arabe bella se promène joue à cachecache et lit des livres pour enfants mais elle le fait en plusieurs langues différentes tous ses cours se déroulent sous forme de jeu ses parents organisent des voyages ludiques avec des locuteurs natifs elle fréquente un club de théâtre en anglais apprend le dessin en

langue » explique kira ivanonva spécialiste de l’institut de recherches linguistiques auprès de l’académie russe des sciences cependant un apprentissage précoce ne garantit pas que l’enfant parlera couramment la langue plus tard « je connais une mère qui ne parlait qu’anglais avec son enfant à partir de l’âge de trois ans aujourd’hui ce petit n’est même pas capable de maîtriser le programme
